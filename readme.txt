There are two programs here that will calculate the manhatten distance. ManhattenDistance will interact with the user via command line,
while the ManhattenDistanceFile will take input from a file and print it to an output file.
Both of the ManhattenDistance programs and the test files were complied on windows using mingw and gcc.

ManhattenDistanceFile expects all entries in the input file to follow the following format "x1,y1 x2,y2"
Running this file requires the user to provide two command line argmuents, one for the location of the input file and one for the location of where to place the output file.

Test.c requires three command line argmuents, one for the output after running a testInput file, one for the expected output of the testInput file (i.e. testOutput_sm.txt),
and the number of lines the the test files. 
testOutput_sm has 5 lines
testOutput_lg has 25 lines
